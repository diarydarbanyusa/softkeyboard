=How to install Hebrew fonts in Android=

==Required==
 # A rooted Android. If you want to know how to root an Android, read about it [http://haykuro.theiphoneproject.org/?page_id=35 here].
 # fonts (Hebrew fonts can be downloaded from [http://softkeyboard.googlecode.com/files/hebdroid.zip here]
 # [http://softkeyboard.googlecode.com/files/adb.rar ADB tool], which is a part of the Android SDK.
 # You may need to install the drivers. Get them from [http://softkeyboard.googlecode.com/files/usb_driver.rar here].

==Steps==
 * Connect your phone using USB to the computer.
 * Unzip the Hebrew fonts to the ADB folder, e.g., "c:\adb\"
 * Change directory to the ADB folder.
 * Make the system partition writable:
  * adb shell mount -o rw,remount -t yaffs2 /dev/block/mtdblock3 /system
 * Copy the fonts to the system partition, by typing the following command (in this example I assume the fonts are stored on the local computer at "c:\adb\"):
  * adb push c:\adb\ /system/fonts/
 * We're done - just reboot the device:
  * adb shell reboot
